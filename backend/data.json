            "content": "Mobile application security testing is a key skill in the IT security world, especially nowadays when smartphones are used everywhere. To begin, it’s useful to understand the main differences between web and mobile applications. Mobile apps have local components such as SQLite databases, SharedPreferences files, and OS-dependent permission systems.\n\n**Getting started steps:**\n\n1. **Prepare the environment:** Install an emulator (e.g., AVD from Android Studio) or use a physical rooted device. Tools like `adb`, `Frida`, `Burp Suite`, `MobSF`, and `APKTool` will also be useful.\n\n2. **Static analysis:** Unpack the application (`.apk`) and inspect the code structure. Check the manifest, requested permissions, exported components, and third-party libraries.\n\n3. **Dynamic analysis:** Observe the app’s runtime behavior. Intercept network traffic, test reactions to parameter manipulation, and modify the runtime environment.\n\n4. **Basic attack vectors:**\n   - Improper data storage\n   - Lack of secure network communication (e.g., missing HTTPS, no certificate pinning)\n   - Insecure app components (deeplinks, activities, broadcasts)\n\n5. **Use OWASP MASVS and MSTG:** These are official guidelines and manuals for mobile app security testing. Use them as a checklist.\n\nWhen starting out with mobile app testing, it’s valuable to practice on intentionally vulnerable environments like this VulnForum application. That’s the best way to develop skills in a safe setting.",

            "content": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common vulnerabilities in web applications and in mobile apps that use WebView or dynamic HTML. In this article we will analyze how XSS works, its types, and how it can be exploited using vulnerable applications like VulnForum as examples.\n\n**Types of XSS:**\n\n1. **Stored XSS** – malicious code is saved to a database and executed each time a victim visits the infected page. This is ideal for attacks on forums and comment systems.\n\n2. **Reflected XSS** – JavaScript code is reflected in the server response, e.g., via a URL parameter. It typically requires the user to click a crafted link.\n\n3. **DOM-based XSS** – malicious code is injected without server involvement, solely by manipulating the client-side DOM.\n\n**Example with VulnForum:**\nIn the app a user can add a comment to an article. Lack of HTML filtering allows adding a payload like:\n\n`html\n<h1 style=\"color:red\">XSS works!</h1><script>alert('Pwned!')</script>\n`\n\nAfter saving the comment, this code will execute for anyone who reads it. This is a classic Stored XSS example.\n\n**XSS consequences:**\n- Stealing cookies / tokens\n- Session hijacking\n- Defacement (changing displayed content)\n- Automated actions (e.g., clicking buttons)\n\n**How to defend:**\n- Use proper HTML encoding (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`)\n- Validate and filter user input\n- Use libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize HTML\n\nExploiting XSS is not just about showing alert boxes. In practice it leads to account takeover, UI manipulation, and persistent injection of malicious scripts. Apps like VulnForum let you safely practice discovering and exploiting this vulnerability.",

            "title": "Secure Data Storage on Android — Best Practices",
            "content": "Local data storage is inevitable in mobile applications — it can be access tokens, user preferences, temporary files, or other sensitive information. Unfortunately, many apps do this insecurely, which facilitates reverse engineering, data theft, and privilege escalation.\n\n**Common mistakes:**\n- Storing passwords or tokens in `SharedPreferences` without encryption\n- Keeping data in internal storage without protections\n- Logging sensitive data (e.g., full API responses, JWTs, passwords)\n- Using external SD cards for storage without access control\n\n**Best practices:**\n\n1. **Use EncryptedSharedPreferences or EncryptedFile:**\n   Android Jetpack Security provides ready-made classes for encrypting app data. Keys are safely stored in the Android Keystore.\n\n2. **Avoid long-term tokens:**\n   If not necessary, prefer short-lived sessions or tokens refreshed dynamically from the backend.\n\n3. **Do not log sensitive data:**\n   Logs may be accessible to other apps (e.g., on rooted devices) or via `logcat`. Log only what is needed for debugging — never private data.\n\n4. **Use Internal Storage with restricted access:**\n   Data stored with the app’s private context (`MODE_PRIVATE`) is not accessible to other apps, even without root.\n\n5. **Consider using the Keystore API:**\n   Android Keystore allows creating and using cryptographic keys without exposing them to the application. For example, you can sign or decrypt data without direct access to the key material.\n\n**VulnForum vulnerability example:**\nIn VulnForum, credentials are stored in SharedPreferences in plaintext, making them an easy target for anyone with access to the app files.\n\nGood data storage is the foundation of mobile security. Even the best API security is meaningless if a token is stolen from the device storage.",

            "title": "How to Break JWTs — Token Analysis and Weaknesses",
            "content": "JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for user authorization in web and mobile apps. Their signature-based structure seems secure — however, incorrect implementation can lead to serious security breaches.\n\n### 🔍 JWT Structure\nA JWT token consists of three dot-separated parts:\n\n```\nHEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE\n```\n\n- **Header** – contains the token type and signing algorithm (e.g., HS256)\n- **Payload** – user data (e.g., id, role, expiration)\n- **Signature** – an HMAC or RSA signature that ensures integrity\n\n### ⚠️ Common JWT weaknesses\n\n1. **No signature verification**\n   - The backend accepts tokens without checking the signature (often in test implementations)\n   - This allows payload tampering and privilege escalation (e.g., \\\"role\\\": \\\"admin\\\")\n\n2. **Using the \\\"none\\\" algorithm**\n   - Older libraries allowed `alg: none` in the header — meaning no signature. Some servers accepted such tokens!\n\n3. **Weak or known secret (HS256)**\n   - An HMAC-signed JWT can be brute-forced if the secret is too simple (e.g., \\\"12345\\\")\n   - Tools like `jwt-cracker` can quickly try common secrets\n\n4. **No rotation or token expiration**\n   - A token valid for days gives an attacker plenty of time if leaked\n   - Lack of refresh/revocation mechanisms leads to abuse\n\n5. **Too much data in the payload**\n   - Sensitive information in the payload is easy to read — JWT is base64-encoded, not encrypted\n\n### 🧪 Example from VulnForum\nIn VulnForum, the JWT is signed with HS256 using a very weak secret — easily crackable. After decoding you can:\n- Change \\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\" to \\\"admin\\\"\n- Set the expiration far in the future\n- Send the token to the API and gain admin access\n\n### 🛡️ How to defend\n- Use strong, long secrets\n- Always validate the signature regardless of the header\n- Never use the \\\"none\\\" algorithm\n- Consider RSA/ECDSA JWTs if you can manage keys\n- Keep sensitive data on the server side, not in the JWT payload\n\nJWT is powerful — but only when used correctly.",

This skill is useful for both pentesters and security researchers.\n\n### 🔧 What you need\n\n- `apktool` – to decompile APK into smali format\n- `jadx` or `jeb` – to view reconstructed Java-like code\n- `Frida`, `Xposed`, `Objection` – for dynamic analysis\n- An emulator or a rooted/debug-enabled physical device\n\n### 📦 Step 1 – Decompile the APK\nStart by unpacking the APK:\n\n`bash\napktool d VulnForum.apk -o VulnForum_decoded\n`\n\nThe folder contents will show the app structure: layouts, AndroidManifest, smali.\n\n### 🔍 Step 2 – Static analysis\nUse `jadx-gui` to browse the reconstructed Java code:\n\n`bash\njadx-gui VulnForum.apk\n`\n\nLook for:\n- Hardcoded tokens / API keys\n- Improper encryption\n- Exported activities (`exported=\"true\"` in the manifest)\n\n### 🧪 Step 3 – Dynamic analysis\nInstall the app on an emulator and connect Frida:\n\n`bash\nfrida-ps -U | grep VulnForum\n`\n\nYou can hook functions, monitor login methods, decode JWTs, etc. Example:\n\n`javascript\nJava.perform(() => {\n  const AuthClass = Java.use(\"com.vulnforum.auth.AuthUtils\");\n  AuthClass.verifyToken.implementation = function(token) {\n    console.log(\"Intercepted token:\", token);\n    return this.verifyToken(token);\n  };\n});\n`\n\n### 💡 Practical goals in VulnForum\n- Locate encryption routines and try to decrypt data\n- Identify payment validation functions and attempt to modify them\n- Find hidden/deeplinked activities and launch them manually\n\n### 🛡️ Security tips\n- Avoid hardcoded secrets\n- Use proguard/obfuscation\n- Apply layered security — never trust the client\n\nReverse engineering is a fundamental offensive tool and a great way to test the quality of your own app.",

            "content": "Deeplinks let mobile apps respond to specially crafted URLs (e.g., `vulnforum://article/5`). While useful, improper configuration can lead to serious security breaches.\n\n### 🚨 Deeplink-related threats\n\n1. **Unauthorized access to features** – if a deeplink opens a sensitive screen without verifying session/authentication.\n2. **Intent hijacking** – another malicious app can intercept the deeplink if the app doesn’t define intent filters correctly or uses `android:exported=\"false\"` incorrectly.\n3. **Parameter injection via URL** – some apps inject deeplink parameters without filtering (e.g., into WebView or SQL queries).\n\n### 🔧 Vulnerability in practice\nConsider this deeplink:\n\n`\nvulnforum://message/send?to=bob&text=hello\n`\n\nIf the app:\n- doesn’t verify who is sending the message,\n- doesn’t restrict who can use that deeplink,\n\n...then any other app could call that link and send a message on behalf of the user.\n\n### 🧪 Testing the vulnerability\n\nIn Android Studio you can test a deeplink with:\n`bash\nadb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d \"vulnforum://article/2\"\n`\n\nYou can also build a small app that opens vulnerable links to VulnForum.\n\n### 🛡️ Best practices\n\n- **Validate authorization** – even if a deeplink opens an activity, enforce authentication in code.\n- **Set `android:exported=\"false\"` where appropriate** – this limits access to internal components.\n- **Use `intent-filter` carefully** – only where necessary.\n- **Filter input data** – never trust deeplink parameters.\n\n### 💥 VulnForum and deeplinks\nVulnForum contains activities vulnerable to deeplink attacks. Try to:\n- Send a message with another user’s permissions\n- Access paid content without payment\n- Bypass login screens\n\nDeeplink attacks are a great starting point for exploit chains, especially combined with other flaws like missing authorization or weak authentication.",
